squashfs for Debian
-------------------

The  Squash  filesystem driver  isn't  [currently]  integrated in  the
official Linux  kernel, so to  be able to  use such a  filesystem, you
need  to use  the 'squashfs-modules-*'  package if  you are  using the
official Debian kernel, or the 'squashfs-source' package otherwise (by
using 'module-assistant': '# m-a install squashfs').
