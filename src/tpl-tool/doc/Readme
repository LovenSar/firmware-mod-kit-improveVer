Description:

    tpl-tool is a tool for extracting and rebuilding official TP-Link
    firmware images for their router products.

    It has been successfully tested with twenty four different images
    from seven different products. This is only a very small selection of
    the hundred and something available from the TP-Link website. However
    it should work with any official or third-party firmware image which
    uses the same format with the exception of OpenWrt images.

    OpenWrt images do NOT have a 'standard' TP-Link image layout despite
    having a valid header and do NOT extract correctly.


Usage:

    tpl-tool <option> <file> [-o <file>]

    -s <file>   Show image header information in a human readable form.

    -x <file>   Extracts the individual parts of an image to the following
                files.

                    <file>-header
                    <file>-bootldr  (when present)
                    <file>-kernel
                    <file>-rootfs

                Where <file> is either the input filename or that
                specified with -o

    -b <file>   Rebuilds an image from the individual parts extracted
                with -x

                    <file>-header
                    <file>-bootldr  (when present)
                    <file>-kernel
                    <file>-rootfs

                Where <file> is the input filename and the output file
                either <file>-new or that specified with -o

    -o <file>   Specify an alternative output filename.

    -h          Show version and usage info.
