  cramfsswap - swap endianess of a cram filesystem (cramfs)
  version 1.1


  cramfs is a highly compressed and size optimized linux filesystem which is
  mainly used for embedded applications. the problem with cramfs is that it
  is endianess sensitive, meaning you can't mount a cramfs for a big endian
  target on a little endian machine and vice versa. this is often especially 
  a problem in the development phase.

  cramfsswap solves that problem by allowing you to swap to endianess of a
  cramfs filesystem.
