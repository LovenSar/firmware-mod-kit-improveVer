DESCRIPTION
	
	CRCalc re-calculates and updates the CRC fields of uImage, TRX, and DLOB firmware headers.

	CRCalc can update multiple headers inside a firmware image if you provide it with a list
	of offsets for each header inside the firmware image. The list file can be a binwalk log
	or just a list of decimal offsets (one offset per line).

	If no binwalk log or list file is provided, CRCalc assumes that there is only one header
	at the very beginning of the target firmware image.

USAGE
	
	Basic usage:
	
		$ crcalc firmware.img

	Usage with a binwalk log / offset list file:

		$ crcalc firmware.img binwalk.log
